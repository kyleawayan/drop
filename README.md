# drop
Randomly choose a Fortnite droping location, including unmarked waypoints. Unmarked waypoints will have map coordinates and map screenshots attatched.

## Usage
`[p]drop` or `[p]where`.

## Installation
First use `[p]datapath` to find the bot directory. `cd` into it. Then run:
```
cd cogs/CogManager/cogs
git clone https://github.com/kyleawayan/drop/
```
After that link the path to your bot by using `[p]addpath /home/.../cogs/CogManager/cogs/drop`. Replace the path in the command with your appropriate path.

Load the cog with `[p]load drop`.

## To-Do
- [X] Add üîÅ reaction button to execute command without having to type command again
- [X] Eliminate having six millions ifs for map screenshots
- [ ] Make sure not to repeat same spot again
